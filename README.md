# personal-lib-index
A simplified index of books which I am interested in in my school library.
I created this index or list of book information intended for my own use, but I believe it is a good thing to share the list. By the way, this is the very first time I have tried to use github for uploading something so I just want to see the actual effect as a rookie.
